Tomas and Dustin met digitally during a digital presence mastermind. Which led them both to meeting in real life on the [Nomad Cruise](https://nomadcruise.com "Nomad Cruise"). During the 8 day conference across the Atlantic, the two of them swapped their life stories and experiences in the world of lifestyle engineering. 

On board the ship during a heated conversation about nothing, Dustin and Tomas (along with a few other friends) assembled the Life in White Noise Podcast.
